​	This morning's session was dedicated to enhancing error handling in React applications by leveraging interceptors. Interceptors are a powerful feature often used in conjunction with HTTP client libraries like Axios to process requests and responses before they are handled by the rest of the application. By implementing an interceptor, you can centralize error handling, which allows for a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. For example, you can automatically catch HTTP errors, log them for debugging purposes, and present user-friendly error messages. This approach ensures that error handling logic is abstracted away from the business logic of your components, leading to a more robust application architecture.

​	In the afternoon, the focus will shift towards understanding the integration of front-end and back-end systems, a crucial aspect of full-stack development. This part of the learning session will likely cover how the front-end can communicate with the back-end through APIs, the importance of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and how to manage data flow between the two. Additionally, the session will introduce the concept of cloud computing, which has become an essential element in modern software development.

​	The cloud computing segment will delve into the basics of cloud services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). It will also explore how cloud resources can be leveraged for hosting web applications, providing scalable databases, and ensuring reliable application deployment with services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. The session may also touch upon the benefits of cloud computing, including scalability, cost-efficiency, and high availability, as well as potential challenges like security and data privacy.

​	**Morning Session: React's Interceptor for Error Handling**

In the morning, the focus was on understanding and implementing interceptors in React applications, specifically for the purpose of error handling. React itself doesn't come with built-in interceptors, but they are commonly used in conjunction with Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

​	Interceptors are functions that Axios calls for every request or response. Two types of interceptors were likely covered:

- **Request Interceptors**: These allow you to modify the request before it is sent to the server. This could be used to add authentication tokens, set headers, or even log the outgoing request for debugging purposes.
- **Response Interceptors**: These are used to handle responses from the server before they are processed by `then` or `catch`. You can use these to globally handle errors, such as by showing a toast notification to the user when a 401 (Unauthorized) or 500 (Server Error) status code is received.

​	The key takeaway from this session would be how to write clean, centralized, and reusable error handling logic that can be applied across the entire application, thereby improving the user experience and making the codebase more maintainable.

**Afternoon Session: Front-End and Back-End Integration & Cloud Computing**

​	The afternoon's learning journey is expected to transition into the integration of front-end and back-end systems, which is a crucial aspect of full-stack web development. This integration is typically achieved through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), where the front-end makes HTTP requests to the back-end services, and the back-end sends back data that the front-end can display.

​	Key points that may be covered include:

- **API Communication**: How the front-end uses APIs to request data from the back-end, and how the back-end serves these requests.
- **CORS**: Understanding Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and why it's important for security in a web application. You'll learn how to configure CORS to allow your front-end to communicate with your back-end when they are not hosted on the same domain.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: How to securely manage user sessions and permissions between the front-end and back-end.

​	The session will also introduce cloud computing concepts, which are increasingly important in both front-end and back-end development:

- **Cloud Service Models**: Familiarization with IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, and how they differ from traditional hosting.
- **Cloud Providers**: An overview of major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, and their service offerings.
- **Benefits of Cloud Computing**: Scalability, cost-efficiency, reliability, and how cloud services can be leveraged for deploying web applications.
- **Challenges**: Addressing common concerns such as security, data privacy, and compliance in the cloud.
