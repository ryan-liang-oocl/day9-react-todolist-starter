​	This morning's focus was on understanding the lifecycle of React components, which are crucial for managing the creation, updating, and destruction of components within a React application. Additionally, the session covered the use of React Hooks, which are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` are examples that likely were discussed, as they are commonly used to manage state, side effects, and context in a more modern and succinct way compared to class-based components.

​	This afternoon's schedule includes a presentation, which could be an opportunity to share insights, demonstrate new features, or discuss the implementation of what was learned in the morning session. The retrospective that follows aims to reflect on past work, identifying what went well and what could be improved. This is a common practice in Agile methodologies, fostering continuous improvement and team collaboration. The retrospective will likely involve discussing issues that arose, how they were addressed, and what lessons can be taken forward to future sprints or projects.
