​	This morning's session concentrated on exploring the functionalities associated with routing in web applications, specifically how to manage and navigate between different views or components without the need for a full page reload. The learning likely involved using a popular library like React Router, which is a standard for handling in-app routing in React applications. Key concepts might have included setting up `BrowserRouter`, defining `Routes` and `Route` components, utilizing `Link` or `NavLink` components for navigation, and understanding dynamic routing with path parameters.

In the afternoon, the focus will shift to learning how to implement UI components using the Ant Design (AntD) component library. Ant Design is a comprehensive UI design system that provides a plethora of out-of-the-box components tailored for building high-quality, interactive user interfaces in React applications. The session will probably cover:

1. **Installation and Setup**: How to install Ant Design in a React project and properly import the required CSS styles.
2. **Components Overview**: Familiarization with the range of components available in Ant Design, such as buttons, forms, tables, modals, and more.
3. **Usage and Customization**: Instructions on how to use these components within React components, how to pass props for customization, and how to handle events.
4. **Layout and Design**: Learning about the layout components provided by Ant Design, such as `Grid`, `Layout`, and how to use them to create responsive designs.
5. **Theming**: Understanding how to customize the default theme to match the application's branding, possibly by overriding Ant Design variables.
6. **Best Practices**: Discussion around best practices when using a UI library, such as maintaining accessibility, performance considerations, and code maintainability.

1. **Progressive Learning Approach**: The structure of the learning sessions suggests a progressive approach to building web application skills. The morning's focus on routing with React Router sets a foundation for navigation within single-page applications (SPAs), a core functionality in modern web development. The afternoon session builds on this by enhancing the user interface with Ant Design components, suggesting a curriculum designed to develop both functional and aesthetic aspects of web applications.
2. **Emphasis on Modern Web Practices**: The use of React Router and Ant Design indicates that the training is up-to-date with current industry standards and practices. React Router is a de facto standard for routing in React SPAs, and Ant Design is a popular UI framework that aligns with contemporary design principles.
3. **Hands-on Application**: The session descriptions imply that participants are expected to apply what they learn practically. This could involve coding exercises where learners implement routing in a sample application and then enhance the UI with Ant Design components.
4. **Comprehensive Skill Development**: The sessions cover a range of skills from installation, configuration, and basic usage to more advanced topics like responsive design and theming. This suggests a holistic approach to learning, aiming to equip participants with a broad skill set that can be applied to various aspects of React development.
5. **Focus on Best Practices**: The mention of best practices indicates that the program is not just about learning to use tools but also about understanding how to do so effectively and responsibly. Topics like accessibility, performance, and maintainability are crucial for creating high-quality web applications that provide a good user experience and are easy to maintain over time.
6. **Outcome-Oriented Training**: The ultimate goal of the sessions is to enable participants to integrate what they've learned into their React applications, implying that the training is designed with practical outcomes in mind. The expectation is that by the end of the afternoon, learners will be ready to create more polished and user-friendly interfaces with Ant Design.
7. **Balanced Curriculum**: The curriculum balances both the technical (routing logic, component implementation) and the creative (UI design, theming) aspects of web development, which are both essential for the development of full-fledged web applications.
